description: The Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund is one of the UN's country-based
  pooled funds. Contributions are collected into a single, unearmarked fund and
  managed locally under UN leadership. As crises evolve, funds are made directly
  and immediately available to a wide range of partner organizations at the
  front lines of response. This way, funding reaches the people most in need
  when they need it.
