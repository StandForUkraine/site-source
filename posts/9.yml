description: Razom initiates short and long-term projects or collaborates on
  existing projects with partner organizations, which help Ukraine stay on the
  path of fostering democracy and prosperity. We've grown a diverse community of
  volunteers and collaborators across the US and Ukraine which allows us to
  create spaces where people can meet, partner, and execute these projects.
